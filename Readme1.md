# Disease Prediction Model with Explainable AI (XAI)

## **Overview**
This project builds a machine learning model for disease prediction using a **Random Forest Classifier** and interprets its predictions using **Explainable AI (XAI)** techniques with **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**. 

The goal is to predict disease outcomes based on input features and provide interpretable insights into how each feature influences the predictions. This repository includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and SHAP-based interpretability analysis.

## **2. Dataset Overview**
- **Dataset Source**: [Diabetes Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/diabetes.csv)
- **Description**:  
  This dataset includes medical attributes such as glucose levels, BMI, age, and more, with a binary target variable indicating disease presence or absence.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age**  
  - **Outcome (Target Variable)**: 0 (No Disease) or 1 (Disease)

You can modify this dataset reference if you are using a different resource or custom dataset.

## **3. Data Preprocessing**
1. **Loading Data**: Read the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Checking for Missing Values**: Identify and handle any NaN or outliers.
3. **Splitting Data**: Typically, 80% training and 20% testing.
4. **Feature Encoding**: If there are categorical variables, encode them as needed.
5. **Scaling or Normalization**: Apply standard scaling where appropriate.

<a id="4-model-training"></a>
## **4. Model Training**
- **Random Forest Classifier** is used with 100 estimators as a baseline.
- **Parameter Tuning** (optional): You can tune hyperparameters, such as `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, and `min_samples_split`.
- **Training**: Train the model using the chosen training set (e.g., 80% of total data).

<a id="5-model-evaluation"></a>
## **5. Model Evaluation**
- **Metrics**:
  - **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of predictions.
  - **Confusion Matrix**: Visual summary of prediction outcomes.
  - **Classification Report**: Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Plot the confusion matrix for easy understanding.
  - (Optional) ROC Curve to analyze trade-offs between TPR and FPR.

## **6. Explainable AI (XAI) with SHAP**
- **SHAP KernelExplainer** or **TreeExplainer** is used to interpret the model’s predictions.
- **Global Interpretability**:
  - **SHAP Summary Plots** highlight which features contribute most to the model’s decisions.
- **Local Interpretability**:
  - **Force Plots** help visualize a single data point’s prediction explanation.

<a id="7-conclusion-and-next-steps"></a>
## **7. Conclusion and Next Steps**
- **Findings**:
  - The Random Forest model offers robust performance for binary disease classification.
  - SHAP plots clearly identify which features most strongly influence predictions.
- **Recommendations**:
  - Experiment with additional models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks).
  - Conduct hyperparameter tuning to further refine performance.
  - Expand the dataset to include more features or more diverse patient samples.
